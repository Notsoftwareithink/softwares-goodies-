Chapter 1 if crash 

1 (IF someone is threatening to crash let him
For the admins will get info on the crash and can patch it)

2 (IF they keep spamming the crash it after many times notify an admin through discord
Or you can notify through gmod :example .@mkmhome @stormystyx @usernameeee  :)

3 (IF it's night and admins don't respond you can
Seduce them/manipulate them to stop :example "befriend the crasher and tell him to go on another server
And do it":)

4 (the previous lines also work on a server lagger)

Chapter 2 befriending admins

1 (find a veteran admin aka a admin who has high access and unreplacebel
And try to friend him through these ways)

2 (figure out his or hers personality and adapt it)

3 (soon the admin is going to find out that your "personality" 
Is cool and will befriend you)

4 (may not be instant but will happen sometime)

5 (may be asking what's the point of friending a admin
Well they can get you out of bad stuff aka someone caught you crashing or lagging the server
They can bail you out)

Chapter 3 become respected and unkillable
 
1 (like all anarchy servers you will die and be tossed around
I will tell you ways to not be killed and tosses around)

2 (learn prop killing and prop surfing can kill people easily 
And fly away in bad situations you can learn with this link https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572479773
    )

3 (code a ulx hp spam or create binds should be easy enough)

4 (get yourself a multi hack Aimbot, esp, etc to defend with GUNS I recommend this https://phizzofficial.wixsite.com/idiotbox4gmod

Chapter 4 how to lag or even crash Libby's 

1 (the slinky) using gates stacked until prop limit 
Spawn, unfreeze move to desired point and useing the no collide everything press r on EVERYTHING)

2 (the brute force clientside lag thing) spawn some props like 5 and add constraints like ropes until constraint limit
Then dupe and rapid spam spawn said dupe)

3 (the sentinel breaker) this breaks sentinel or atleast it did, spawn glass wheel that is hollow onto wall
Then spawn rag dolls inside it (best if have crash partner) then turn wheel on)
